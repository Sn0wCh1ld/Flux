# Flux 4
Flux 4 was originally intended to be used by the New Year's Development Team as a prank jailbreak, but if you're building a jailbreak and need a UI, feel free to use Flux's, as long as you keep the credits to myself (@JustinAlexP on Twitter), AppleBetas (@AppleBetasDev) and nullpixel (@nullriver)

Eric Rabil of Dynastic Development asked to be mentioned in the readme, so I'd just like to note that he is a nuisance on the NYDT group chat
